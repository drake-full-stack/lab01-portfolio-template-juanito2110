## 📝 Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:
- What was the most challenging part?
  Just deploying the page as i had never deployed a website from github directly, i usually deploy websites with my own domains or other ways. It was fun to learn a new and easy way of deploying a website. 
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
  That the order of the tags is important and i always have to keep that in mind as it can affect the SEO of the website and the performance. 
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?
  I would like to have a variety of projects that do different things to show all my abilities and be able to show that to recruiters and future employers.
