        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p style="width: 50%; height: auto;">Running is the hobbie that takes the most time and effort right now for me, I started running when i was 10 and since then I've been doing it. It has helped me to make a lot of good memories and to come to the US to study and keep running so I'm very grateful for everything that the sport has given me.</p>
        <h3>Skills that I have developed through running:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Discipline</li>
            <strong><li>Leadership</li></strong>
            <li>Goal setting</li>
            <li>Resilience</li>
            <li>Teamwork (specially in college running in a D1 team)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p style="width: 50%; height: auto;">Coding is a hobby that I discovered later in life, but it has quickly become one of my passions. I love the challenge of solving problems and creating something out of nothing. It's incredibly rewarding to see my ideas come to life through code.</p>
